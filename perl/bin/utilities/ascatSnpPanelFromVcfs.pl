USAGE: ascatSnpPanelFromVcfs.pl snps.vcf[.gz]

  This script was created to generate a shared SNP panel for species having
  multiple strains which have become homozygos through in-breeding.

  The resulting output is likely to only be useful in experiments where crossing
  of strains has been performed to add hetrozygous SNPs back into the population.

  The initial use has been against the Mouse Genome Project outputs found here:
    ftp://ftp-mouse.sanger.ac.uk/REL-*-SNPs_Indels/mgp.*.merged.snps_all.*.vcf.gz

  As not all VCF files are created equal you may need to make modifications for
  other sources.
